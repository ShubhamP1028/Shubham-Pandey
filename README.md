Currently, I’m diving into Cloud Computing and DevOps to scale my skills. Welcome to my GitHub, where I share my projects and learning journey!

🌱 Learning: Deepening my expertise in ML, exploring cloud platforms, and mastering Data Engineering and tools.

🚀 Goal: To become a Data Science professional who builds impactful, scalable solutions.

💡 Fun Fact: When I’m not coding, I’m lost in books on philosophy and anthropology, pondering the big questions.
